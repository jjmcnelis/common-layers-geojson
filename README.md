# common vector datasets
This repo keeps geojson copies of common vector datasets for convenient, semi-permanent access.

![docs/browse.PNG](https://github.com/jjmcnelis/common-layers-geojson/blob/master/docs/browse.PNG)      
*Simplified MODIS grid: [modis_sinusoidal-SIMPLE.json](modis_sinusoidal-SIMPLE.json). GitHub has this nice feature that renders GeoJSON objects.*

The raw files can be read directly into processing routines. For example, in Python with `geopandas`:

```python
import geopandas as gpd

u = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjmcnelis/common-layers-geojson/master/modis_sinusoidal-SIMPLE.json"
gpd.read_file(u)
```

## Script

You need gdal/ogr binary tools. You can install like this if you're on ubuntu/debian:
```
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
``` 

Run the shell script [`gen-geojson.sh`](gen-geojson.sh) to download the latest copy of the datasets and generate GeoJSONs:
```shell
chmod +x gen-geojson.sh
./gen-geojson.sh
```

Modify the `ogr2ogr` commands in the script to include the `-simplify <tolerance>` option to reduce vertices (simplify) the output vectors. The JSONs labeled *SIMPLE* in the base directory of this repo have been simplified with `tolerance==0.01` so that they're all under 1MB. The full resolution versions are in the [maxres/](maxres/) folder.
